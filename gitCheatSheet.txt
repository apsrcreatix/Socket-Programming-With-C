Git Cheatsheet
Use this cheatsheet as a reference for each of the steps in the basic git workflow.

How to commit your work for the first time in a new project:

Initialize a repository: type git init. Command line should say "Initialized empty Git repository"
Check the repository: type git status. It should show you the untracked files.
Save your progress: track the file by adding it using git add followed by each of the filenames, one at a time.
Check what has changed: type git status.
Commit the changes: type git commit -m "commit message"
Success! If you type git status You should see "nothing to commit, working directory clean"
Pushing your snapshot to GitHub:

Go to github.com and create a new repository
Add GitHub repository as a remote branch: Use git remote add origin git@github.com... (follow GitHub's instructions for this line)
Send changes to repository: type git push origin master to send your committed changes.
To pull from GitHub: Use the command git pull to keep your version up-to-date with the remote version
